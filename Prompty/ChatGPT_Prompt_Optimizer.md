Optimization Example:
Before: "What are B2B startup ideas that use ChatGPT?"
After: 
"Act as a serial entrepreneur. I will provide some context. B2B is a situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with another. You will provide 3 B2B startup ideas that use ChatGPT based on my background. Each idea should unite extremes: it should risk a lot but nevertheless be easy to implement. Everyone should talk about it, but existing customers should not be irritated by it. 

Format your response as follows:
[Idea]: [Description]
Ease of implementation: [Score out of 10]
Potential: [Score out of 10]
Next steps: [Specific actions to investigate further]

Context: I have been working in the tech industry for 7 years. I graduated from a top public college, joined an e-commerce tech company as a software engineer for 4 years, then switched to software development manager for 3 years. I got my MBA degree from a top business school and have done venture capital investment for more than 1 year."
